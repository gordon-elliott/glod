# Glod

## Specialised ledger utilities

"Bad spelling can be lethal. For example, the greedy Seriph of Al-Yabi was 
cursed by a badly-educated deity and for some days everything he touched 
turned to Glod, which happened to be the name of a small dwarf from a 
mountain community hundreds of miles away who found himself magically 
dragged to the kingdom and relentlessly duplicated. Some two thousand 
Glods later the spell wore off. These days, the people of Al-Yabi are 
renowned for being remarkably short and bad-tempered."
